# Sentiment Analysis of Steam User Reviews

# Project Overview
This project focuses on using advanced machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze user reviews' sentiment. The primary goal is to develop a robust model that can accurately interpret and categorize sentiments in user reviews across various platforms.


# Process 
1) Data Collection: Aggregate a vast dataset of user reviews from multiple relevant sources.
2) Data Preprocessing: 
  - Filter out missing data or outliers, and verify data integrity.
   - Extract and focus on the 'review' text.
   - Convert reviews into a structured format for easier processing.
   - Utilize text embedding techniques to transform review data into a format suitable for machine learning.
3) Model Development:
   - Design and implement NLP models capable of understanding and analyzing sentiment.
   - Employ supervised learning methods, experimenting with different algorithms for optimal results.
4) Model Evaluation: Measure model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, with a primary focus on the Random Forest Classifier.
5) Data Analysis Through Model:
   - Analyze reviews to categorize them as positive or negative.
   - Compare the sentiment ratio from the model with actual user ratings for validation.
   - Perform keyword analysis by genre to gain market insights.
   - Examine correlations between game prices, release dates, and review sentiments.
6) Visualization :
   - Use tools like Tableau for dynamic visualization of sentiment analysis results, highlighting key positive and negative keywords.

# result

# challenge
- Handling large datasets was time-consuming and often led to memory errors.
- Lengthy training times for the model, with delays in identifying and correcting errors.
- Difficulty in interpreting ambiguous or mixed-emotion sentences.
- Challenges in setting definitive standards for measuring consumer emotions.
- Determining the relevance and extent of extracted keywords.

# Futuregoals
- Refine the model to include degrees of sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
- Expand the application of the model to reviews in other sectors beyond gaming.
